{"question": "## New Optimization Problem: Strategic Nurse Staffing with Flexible Shifts and Workforce Constraints\n\nA leading healthcare provider, facing evolving operational demands and workforce management complexities, seeks to optimize its nurse staffing strategy. The hospital requires the following minimum number of nurses during different 4-hour time periods within a 24-hour day:\n\n*   **Period 1 (P1):** 2:00 - 6:00 - 10 nurses\n*   **Period 2 (P2):** 6:00 - 10:00 - 15 nurses\n*   **Period 3 (P3):** 10:00 - 14:00 - 25 nurses\n*   **Period 4 (P4):** 14:00 - 18:00 - 20 nurses\n*   **Period 5 (P5):** 18:00 - 22:00 - 18 nurses\n*   **Period 6 (P6):** 22:00 - 2:00 - 12 nurses\n\nNurses can be hired from two categories: Regular Staff Nurses and Contract Nurses. To enhance flexibility and manage costs, the hospital now allows for two standard continuous shift durations, and introduces overtime options and new workforce constraints. All shifts must commence at the beginning of a 4-hour period (2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00).\n\n**Nurse Categories and Costs:**\n\n1.  **Regular Staff Nurses:**\n    *   **Standard Shift:** Can work either a 4-hour shift or an 8-hour shift at a base salary of **$10/hour**.\n    *   **Overtime Option:** Regular staff nurses assigned to an 8-hour shift can optionally extend their shift by an additional 4 hours (for a total of 12 continuous hours). The additional 4 hours are compensated at an overtime rate of **$15/hour**. Each regular nurse can be assigned to only one primary shift (4-hour or 8-hour) per day, and if an 8-hour shift, can opt for the single 4-hour extension.\n2.  **Contract Nurses:**\n    *   **Standard Shift:** Can work either a 4-hour shift or an 8-hour shift at a fixed rate of **$15/hour**. Contract nurses do not have an overtime option.\n\n**New Constraints and Strategic Objectives:**\n\nTo optimize staffing while meeting strategic organizational goals, the hospital must adhere to the following constraints:\n\n1.  **Workforce Cap for Regular Staff:** The total number of *individual* Regular Staff Nurses employed (across all 4-hour and 8-hour shifts) cannot exceed **40 nurses** in any 24-hour period.\n2.  **Overtime Utilization Limit:** A maximum of **10 individual Regular Staff Nurses** can utilize the 4-hour overtime extension option across the entire 24-hour period.\n3.  **Minimum Contract Nurse Presence:** To maintain a flexible pool and strong agency relationships, there must be at least **2 contract nurses** (from either 4-hour or 8-hour shifts) on duty during *each* of the six 4-hour time periods.\n4.  **Minimum Regular Staff Coverage:** For continuity of care and institutional knowledge, at least **60% of the total nurse hours required** in any given 4-hour period must be covered by Regular Staff Nurses (including their overtime hours).\n5.  **Shift Coverage:** The total number of nurses on duty during any 4-hour period must meet or exceed the specified demand for that period.\n\n**The Optimization Problem:**\n\nFormulate a mathematical optimization model to determine the optimal number of each type of nurse (Regular 4-hour, Regular 8-hour, Regular 8-hour with Overtime, Contract 4-hour, Contract 8-hour) to schedule for each batch starting time (2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00), such that the **total daily cost of nurse staffing is minimized** while satisfying all demand requirements and the new workforce constraints."}

{"question": "In an evolution of the logistical challenges faced by the global logistics company, the demand for their services has increased, necessitating a more complex and efficient distribution strategy. Instead of a single shipment, the company now needs to manage daily deliveries to its six regional distribution centers (Cities 1 to 6) from a central logistics hub, which we'll call the \"Depot\" (City 0).\n\nThe company operates a fleet of identical delivery vehicles, each with a specific carrying capacity. Each distribution center requires a certain quantity of goods, and these deliveries must occur within specific time windows unique to each center. Furthermore, to comply with labor regulations and ensure driver well-being, the total duration of any vehicle's route, including travel and service time at each center, cannot exceed a maximum working hour limit. Each vehicle used incurs a fixed operational cost in addition to the travel expenses.\n\nThe objective is no longer to find a single, minimum-cost circuit. Instead, the company must determine the optimal routing plan for its fleet of vehicles, assigning deliveries to vehicles and sequencing visits within each route. This plan must ensure that all distribution centers receive their required shipments, all deliveries occur within their specified time windows, no vehicle exceeds its capacity or maximum route duration, and all vehicles start and end their day at the Depot. The ultimate goal is to minimize the total operational cost, which includes the fixed cost for each vehicle utilized and the cumulative travel costs across all chosen routes.\n\nThe travel costs between distribution centers (Cities 1-6) remain consistent with the original problem. For instance, traveling from City 1 to City 4 costs 38 units, and from City 3 to City 5 costs 17 units.

The cost for a commercial as well as the expected audience reach remains the same:\n*   On Pi TV, a commercial costs $1200 and attracts 2000 viewers.\n*   On Beta Video, a commercial costs $2000 and attracts 5000 viewers.\n*   On Gamma Live, a commercial costs $4000 and attracts 9000 viewers.\n\nDue to updated platform agreements and strategic goals:\n*   Beta Video now allows a maximum of 10 commercials from a single company.\n*   Pi TV, despite its cost-effectiveness, should not carry more than 15 commercials to ensure diverse reach.\n*   To leverage its premium audience, a minimum of 25% of all commercials must occur on Gamma Live.\n*   To prevent over-exposure on a single, potentially niche, platform, at most 40% of all commercials should occur on Pi TV.\n*   The company aims for a robust overall presence, requiring a minimum of 15 commercials in total across all platforms.\n*   The expanded weekly budget for commercials is now $30000.\n\nHow many commercials should be run in each of the three possible choices in order to maximize total audience reach?\n\n**Formalizing the New Optimization Problem:**\n\nLet:\n*   `x_P` be the number of commercials on Pi TV\n*   `x_B` be the number of commercials on Beta Video\n*   `x_G` be the number of commercials on Gamma Live\n\n**Objective Function:**\nMaximize total audience reach:\nMaximize `Z = 2000x_P + 5000x_B + 9000x_G`\n\n**Subject to the New Constraints:**\n1.  **Beta Video Commercial Limit:** `x_B <= 10`\n2.  **Pi TV Commercial Limit:** `x_P <= 15`\n3.  **Gamma Live Minimum Share:** `x_G >= 0.25 * (x_P + x_B + x_G)`\n    *   (Simplified: `0.75x_G >= 0.25x_P + 0.25x_B` or `3x_G >= x_P + x_B`)\n4.  **Pi TV Maximum Share:** `x_P <= 0.40 * (x_P + x_B + x_G)`\n    *   (Simplified: `0.60x_P <= 0.40x_B + 0.40x_G` or `3x_P <= 2x_B + 2x_G`)\n5.  **Total Minimum Commercials:** `x_P + x_B + x_G >= 15`\n6.  **Weekly Budget:** `1200x_P + 2000x_B + 4000x_G <= 30000`\n7.  **Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:**\n    `x_P, x_B, x_G >= 0` and are integers."}
{"question": "A zookeeper feeds a gorilla with bananas and mangoes. Each banana contains 80 calories, 20 grams of potassium, and 10 grams of sugar, and costs $0.50. Each mango contains 100 calories, 15 grams of potassium, and 8 grams of sugar, and costs $0.75. The gorilla must consume at least 4000 calories but no more than 6000 calories. It also needs at least 150 grams of potassium. To prevent aggression, the total sugar intake must not exceed 300 grams.

{"question": "A common class of problems similar to the original one involves **resource allocation** and **blending problems** often solved using **Linear Programming (LP)** or **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**. These types of problems appear in various fields:\n\n1.  **Production Planning:** A manufacturer needs to produce different products using limited resources (raw materials, machine hours, labor). The goal might be to maximize profit while meeting minimum demand for certain products, or minimize production cost while meeting targets.\n2.  **Portfolio Optimization:** An investor wants to allocate funds among various assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) to achieve a desired return while minimizing risk, subject to constraints like asset class limits or minimum returns.\n3.  **Chemical Blending:** A company needs to mix different raw chemicals to produce a final product with specific properties (e.g., minimum concentration of active ingredients, maximum level of impurities) at the lowest possible cost.\n4.  **Logistics and Transportation:** Optimizing routes and shipments to minimize cost or time, while meeting delivery deadlines and capacity constraints.\n5.  **Staffing and Scheduling:** Determining the optimal number of employees for different shifts or tasks to meet service levels while minimizing labor costs, subject to labor laws or contract agreements.\n\nThe original problem is a classic **\"Diet Problem\"** variation, where the goal is to meet nutritional requirements while minimizing an undesirable component (fat) under budgetary/preference constraints.\n\nHere's a new optimization problem constructed with a different background, following the same structure:\n\n```\nA tech company is developing a new AI model that requires two types of computing resources: standard CPUs and specialized GPUs.

{"question": "A farmer plans agricultural operations for the upcoming growing season, managing 500 acres of land to cultivate turnips and pumpkins. Instead of merely deciding acreage, the farmer faces the complex task of scheduling the actual farming processes, which involve a sequence of operations utilizing limited specialized equipment and crews. The primary goal is to minimize the total time required to complete all farming operations for the season, known as the makespan, while adhering to resource availability, budget, and physical constraints.\n\nFor each crop (turnips and pumpkins), four sequential operations must be performed: Planting, Watering, Pesticide Application, and Harvesting. The duration of each operation depends directly on the number of acres allocated to that specific crop. The farmer has a single Planting Crew, one Irrigation System, one Spraying Machine, and one Harvesting Crew. Crucially, each of these shared resources can only perform one operation at a time, meaning operations using the same resource cannot overlap.\n\n**Specifics for Operations and Resources (drawing from Problem A's background):**\n\n*   **Planting:** Requires 10 minutes per acre for both turnips and pumpkins. This operation utilizes the **Planting Crew**.\n*   **Watering:** Requires 50 minutes per acre for turnips and 90 minutes per acre for pumpkins. This operation utilizes the **Irrigation System**. The total time spent watering across all crops must not exceed 40,000 minutes.\n*   **Pesticide Application:** Requires 20 minutes per acre for turnips and 15 minutes per acre for pumpkins. This operation utilizes the **Spraying Machine**. Additionally, this operation incurs a material cost of $80 per acre for turnips and $50 per acre for pumpkins. The total pesticide cost must not exceed $34,000.\n*   **Harvesting:** Requires 40 minutes per acre for turnips and 60 minutes per acre for pumpkins. This operation utilizes the **Harvesting Crew**.\n\nThe farmer must simultaneously determine the total acres to allocate for each crop (`x_T` for turnips, `x_P` for pumpkins) and schedule all associated operations to minimize the makespan.\n\n**Optimization Problem Formulation:**\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n*   `x_T`: Non-negative continuous variable representing the total acres allocated to turnips.\n*   `x_P`: Non-negative continuous variable representing the total acres allocated to pumpkins.\n*   `S_{crop, op}`: Non-negative continuous variable representing the start time of `op` for `crop` (e.g., `S_{T, Planting}` for planting turnips, `S_{P, Watering}` for watering pumpkins).\n*   `C_{crop, op}`: Non-negative continuous variable representing the completion time of `op` for `crop` (e.g., `C_{T, Planting}`, `C_{P, Watering}`).\n*   `M`: Non-negative continuous variable representing the overall makespan (total completion time of all farming operations).\n*   `y_{resource}`: Binary variable for each shared resource (`PlantingCrew`, `IrrigationSystem`, `SprayingMachine`, `HarvestingCrew`). `y_{resource} = 1` if the operation for turnips on that resource precedes the operation for pumpkins; `y_{resource} = 0` otherwise.\n\n**Derived Processing Times (Durations):**\n*   `D_{T, Planting} = 10 * x_T`\n*   `D_{T, Watering} = 50 * x_T`\n*   `D_{T, Pesticide} = 20 * x_T`\n*   `D_{T, Harvesting} = 40 * x_T`\n*   `D_{P, Planting} = 10 * x_P`\n*   `D_{P, Watering} = 90 * x_P`\n*   `D_{P, Pesticide} = 15 * x_P`\n*   `D_{P, Harvesting} = 60 * x_P`\n\n**Objective Function:**\nMinimize `M`\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n1.  **Land Capacity (from Problem A):** The total acres planted cannot exceed the available land.\n    `x_T + x_P <= 500`\n\n2.  **Minimum Planting Requirement:** To ensure the farmer undertakes meaningful operations, a minimum total acreage must be planted.\n    `x_T + x_P >= 100`\n\n3.  **Pesticide Budget (from Problem A):** The total cost for pesticides across both crops must not exceed the available budget.\n    `80 * x_T + 50 * x_P <= 34000`\n\n4.  **Total Watering Time Budget (from Problem A):** The cumulative time spent watering across all acres of both crops must not exceed the farmer's overall allocated watering capacity.\n    `50 * x_T + 90 * x_P <= 40000`\n\n5.  **Operation Completion Time Definitions:** An operation's completion time is its start time plus its calculated duration.\n    `C_{T, Planting} = S_{T, Planting} + D_{T, Planting}`\n    `C_{T, Watering} = S_{T, Watering} + D_{T, Watering}`\n    `C_{T, Pesticide} = S_{T, Pesticide} + D_{T, Pesticide}`\n    `C_{T, Harvesting} = S_{T, Harvesting} + D_{T, Harvesting}`\n    `C_{P, Planting} = S_{P, Planting} + D_{P, Planting}`\n    `C_{P, Watering} = S_{P, Watering} + D_{P, Watering}`\n    `C_{P, Pesticide} = S_{P, Pesticide} + D_{P, Pesticide}`\n    `C_{P, Harvesting} = S_{P, Harvesting} + D_{P, Harvesting}`\n\n6.  **Precedence Constraints (Sequential Operations for Each Crop):** Operations for a single crop must be performed in the specified order.\n    `C_{T, Planting} <= S_{T, Watering}`\n    `C_{T, Watering} <= S_{T, Pesticide}`\n    `C_{T, Pesticide} <= S_{T, Harvesting}`\n    `C_{P, Planting} <= S_{P, Watering}`\n    `C_{P, Watering} <= S_{P, Pesticide}`\n    `C_{P, Pesticide} <= S_{P, Harvesting}`\n\n7.  **Resource Capacity Constraints (No Overlap on Shared Resources - as in Problem B):** Operations utilizing the same resource (Planting Crew, Irrigation System, Spraying Machine, Harvesting Crew) cannot be performed simultaneously. A large constant, `BigM = 100000`, is used to enforce ordering.\n\n    *   **Planting Crew:**\n        `C_{T, Planting} <= S_{P, Planting} + BigM * y_{PlantingCrew}`\n        `C_{P, Planting} <= S_{T, Planting} + BigM * (1 - y_{PlantingCrew})`\n\n    *   **Irrigation System:**\n        `C_{T, Watering} <= S_{P, Watering} + BigM * y_{IrrigationSystem}`\n        `C_{P, Watering} <= S_{T, Watering} + BigM * (1 - y_{IrrigationSystem})`\n\n    *   **Spraying Machine:**\n        `C_{T, Pesticide} <= S_{P, Pesticide} + BigM * y_{SprayingMachine}`\n        `C_{P, Pesticide} <= S_{T, Pesticide} + BigM * (1 - y_{SprayingMachine})`\n\n    *   **Harvesting Crew:**\n        `C_{T, Harvesting} <= S_{P, Harvesting} + BigM * y_{HarvestingCrew}`\n        `C_{P, Harvesting} <= S_{T, Harvesting} + BigM * (1 - y_{HarvestingCrew})`\n\n8.  **Makespan Definition (as in Problem B):** The makespan must be greater than or equal to the completion time of the very last operation for any crop.\n    `M >= C_{T, Harvesting}`\n    `M >= C_{P, Harvesting}`\n\n9.  **Non-negativity and Variable Type Constraints:**\n    `x_T, x_P >= 0`\n    `S_{crop, op}, C_{crop, op}, M >= 0`\n    `y_{resource} \\in \\{0, 1\\}`"}

If she wins, the net profit for each dollar put on this bet will be $0.50 (meaning she gets her dollar back plus $0.50 profit).\n*   **Soccer Game:** Chance of losing is 10%. If she wins, the net profit for each dollar put on this bet will be $0.10 (meaning she gets her dollar back plus $0.10 profit).\n\nKnowing herself and seeking to maximize her overall expected net profit while managing risk and ensuring diversification, she has established the following rules:\n1.

{"question": "A modern manufacturing facility specializes in producing intricate custom components for `N` distinct client orders, labeled Job 0 through Job `N-1`. Each job requires a sequence of `K` fabrication stages (Operation 0, Operation 1, ..., Operation `K-1`). An operation can only begin once its preceding operation for the same job is fully completed.\n\nThe facility has a fleet of `M_machines` specialized machines, denoted Machine 0 through Machine `M_machines-1`. Each operation `k` of a job `j` (`(j, k)`) is pre-assigned to a specific machine, `MachineAssignment(j, k)`. For instance, Operation 0 of Job 0 might be assigned to Machine 0, while Operation 1 of Job 0 might be assigned to Machine 2. Crucially, multiple operations from different jobs may require the same machine. A machine can only process one operation at a time.\n\nUnlike the previous simplified model, processing times are not uniform. Each operation `(j, k)` has a distinct processing time, `P_{j,k}`, representing the specific duration (in minutes) required for that task. Furthermore, to account for tool changes, calibration, and material handling, a fixed setup time, `S`, is incurred on any machine whenever it begins processing an operation from a job that is *different* from the job it last processed on that machine. If a machine processes two consecutive operations from the same job (e.g., Operation `k` of Job `j` then Operation `k+1` of Job `j`, both on the same machine), no additional setup time is required.\n\nThe primary objective is to develop a comprehensive schedule for all operations such that the total completion time for all jobs, known as the makespan, is minimized. This ensures optimal facility utilization and rapid order fulfillment.\n\n**Key Parameters and Variables (Example Values for illustration):**\n\n*   **Number of Jobs (N):** 5 (Jobs 0 to 4)\n*   **Operations per Job (K):** 3 (Operation 0, Operation 1, Operation 2)\n*   **Number of Machines (M_machines):** 4 (Machines 0, 1, 2, 3)\n*   **Processing Times (P_j,k):** Specific positive integer values for each operation `(j,k)`.\n    *   Example: `P_0,0 = 3 min`, `P_0,1 = 5 min`, `P_0,2 = 2 min`\n    *   `P_1,0 = 4 min`, `P_1,1 = 3 min`, `P_1,2 = 6 min`\n    *   ... (Each `P_j,k > 0`)\n*   **Setup Time (S):** 2 minutes (incurred when a machine switches between different jobs)\n*   **Machine Assignments (MachineAssignment(j,k)):** Each operation is pre-assigned to a specific machine.\n    *   Example: `MachineAssignment(0,0) = 0`, `MachineAssignment(0,1) = 2`, `MachineAssignment(0,2) = 1`\n    *   `MachineAssignment(1,0) = 1`, `MachineAssignment(1,1) = 0`, `MachineAssignment(1,2) = 2`\n    *   ...

{"question": "**New Optimization Problem: Optimizing Resource Allocation via Strategic Initiatives**\n\n**Background:**\nThe Inter-City Resource Management Agency (IRMA) is responsible for ensuring efficient resource distribution across nine interconnected cities, as previously described. While the underlying network involves specific routes, costs, and capacities, IRMA has developed four strategic resource allocation initiatives to streamline its operations. Each initiative bundles various resource movements from surplus cities (e.g., City 0, 2, 4, 5, 8) to demand cities (e.g., City 1, 3, 6, 7), incurring a specific cost per unit of resource processed. The agency's objective is to determine the optimal number of resource units (batches) to allocate to each initiative to minimize total operational costs, while adhering to critical strategic directives and operational constraints. All resource allocations must be in whole units.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\nLet $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ represent the integer number of resource units allocated to the following strategic initiatives:\n\n*   **$x_1$**: Units dedicated to the **Northern Corridor Emergency Supply** initiative, primarily focusing on rapid transfers to meet urgent demands in cities like City 1 and City 3 from major surplus centers (e.g., City 0, City 2).\n*   **$x_2$**: Units for the **Central Region Balancing** initiative, handling routine resource redistribution among the central cluster of cities, particularly from surpluses in City 2, City 4, and City 5 to meet ongoing demands in City 6.\n*   **$x_3$**: Units for the **Southern Hub Logistics** initiative, concentrating on long-range shipments from key supply hubs (e.g., City 0, City 8) to satisfy significant demand in City 7.\n*   **$x_4$**: Units for the **Flexible Reserve Deployment** initiative, representing a strategic buffer of resources held in a central staging area (e.g., City 0) that can be dispatched quickly to any city with an unforeseen surge in demand.\n\n**Costs:**\nBased on historical data from various routes and operational overheads within the city network, the estimated cost per unit for each initiative is:\n\n*   Cost for $x_1$: 7.5 units per resource unit\n*   Cost for $x_2$: 8.0 units per resource unit\n*   Cost for $x_3$: 9.0 units per resource unit\n*   Cost for $x_4$: 6.5 units per resource unit\n\n**Objective Function:**\nThe agency aims to minimize the total operational cost.\nMinimize $Z = 7.5x_1 + 8.0x_2 + 9.0x_3 + 6.5x_4$\n\n**Constraints:**\nThe resource allocation must adhere to the following strategic and operational constraints:\n\n1.  **Northern & Central Capacity Limit:** The combined resources allocated to the Northern Corridor Emergency Supply ($x_1$) and Central Region Balancing ($x_2$) initiatives cannot exceed 45 units, reflecting the current operational capacity for these primary regional movements.\n    $x_1 + x_2 \\le 45$\n\n2.  **Critical Demand Fulfillment:** To ensure sufficient resources reach critical demand zones, twice the units allocated to the Northern Corridor Emergency Supply ($x_1$) plus three times the units allocated to the Southern Hub Logistics ($x_3$) must be at least 50 units.\n    $2x_1 + 3x_3 \\ge 50$\n\n3.  **Flexible Reserve Proportion:** The resources allocated to the Flexible Reserve Deployment ($x_4$) should not exceed half of those allocated to the Central Region Balancing ($x_2$) by more than 10 units.\n    $x_4 - 0.5x_2 \\le 10$\n\n4.  **Operational Balance Target:** A specific operational balance must be maintained across the initiatives. The sum of units for Central Region Balancing ($x_2$) and Flexible Reserve Deployment ($x_4$), minus the sum of units for Northern Corridor Emergency Supply ($x_1$) and Southern Hub Logistics ($x_3$), must precisely equal 5 units.\n    $x_2 + x_4 - x_1 - x_3 = 5$\n\n**Bounds on Variables:**\nEach initiative has minimum and maximum limits on resource allocation based on strategic planning:\n\n*   $x_1$: $[5, 25]$ (Minimum required for emergency preparedness, maximum based on rapid deployment infrastructure)\n*   $x_2$: $[10, 30]$ (Ensuring active regional distribution, within logistical limits)\n*   $x_3$: $[0, 20]$ (Southern hub is optional but cap-limited)\n*   $x_4$: $[0, 15]$ (Reserve is important but finite and costly to maintain)\n\n**Integer Requirement:**\nAll variables $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ must be non-negative integers.\n\n**Question:**\nWhat is the minimum total operational cost (rounded off to two decimal places) associated with optimally allocating resources across these four strategic initiatives?"}

Maximizing profit in this context, given a budget, is equivalent to minimizing total costs subject to meeting demand within the budget, but with the added constraints of the problem type. However, for \"maximize profit\" we use sales as `D_At` and `D_Bt` assuming all produced items up to demand are sold, and surplus becomes inventory.)\n\nA more standard \"maximize profit\" for production planning would be `sum (SP_A * Sales_At + SP_B * Sales_Bt) - sum (Costs)`. Since demand *must be met*, `Sales_At = D_At`. The objective simplifies to minimizing total costs given that revenue is fixed.\n\nLet's re-frame the objective to align with Problem B's \"maximize total number of bottles filled\" idea using the \"value\" of items produced, which is more common in an LP/ILP when budget is a constraint, and demand is mandatory.\n\n**Revised Objective Function:**\nMaximize the total \"contribution margin\" from produced goods, effectively maximizing the total number of items produced that can be sold, given the fixed demand and budget. Or, more simply, maximize total revenue *within the budget*, assuming all demand will be met.\n\nLet's use a simpler objective that is common for this type of ILP with a budget: Maximize the total units produced *that can be sold*, which would be `sum(D_At)` or `sum(P_At)` where `P_At` implies satisfying `D_At`.\n\nGiven the background, a more practical objective, aligned with maximizing \"value\" like in Problem B, would be to maximize the total sales revenue generated, while ensuring all costs are within the budget and demand is met. Since demand *must* be met, the total sales revenue `sum(SP_A * D_At + SP_B * D_Bt)` is a constant. Therefore, to maximize profit, we effectively minimize cost, subject to a budget.\n\nLet's use the straightforward objective of maximizing total units produced across both products and all periods, given a budget and mandatory demand satisfaction, similar to Problem B's \"maximize total number of bottles.\"\n\n**New Objective Function:**\nMaximize the total quantity of products produced across all periods for both Product A and Product B.\nMaximize `Z = sum_{t=0 to 6} (P_At + P_Bt)`\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n1.  **Inventory Balance:** For each product `i` (A, B) and period `t` (0, ..., 6):\n    *   `I_i,t-1 + P_it - D_it = I_it`\n    *   (Where `I_i,-1 = 0` for initial inventory)\n\n2.  **Resource Capacity:** For each period `t` (0, ..., 6):\n    *   `(ResU_A * P_At) + (ResU_B * P_Bt) <= R_t`\n\n3.  **Production Upper Bounds:** For each product `i` (A, B) and period `t` (0, ..., 6):\n    *   `P_At <= MaxP_At`\n    *   `P_Bt <= MaxP_Bt`\n\n4.  **Final Inventory:** At the end of Period 6, all inventory must be depleted:\n    *   `I_A6 = 0`\n    *   `I_B6 = 0`\n\n5.  **Non-negativity and Integer Constraints:**\n    *   `P_At >= 0`, `P_Bt >= 0` (integer)\n    *   `I_At >= 0`, `I_Bt >= 0` (integer)\n\n6.  **Total Budget Constraint:** The sum of all production, inventory holding, and fixed setup costs must not exceed the total budget.\n    *   `sum_{t=0 to 6} (C_At * P_At + C_Bt * P_Bt + H_At * I_At + H_Bt * I_Bt + S_At + S_Bt) <= BUDGET`\n\n7.  **Production Ratio Constraint (inspired by Problem B's jar ratio):**\n    To maintain a balanced product mix, the total quantity of Product A produced over the entire planning horizon must be at least 80% of the total quantity of Product B produced.\n    *   `sum_{t=0 to 6} P_At >= 0.8 * sum_{t=0 to 6} P_Bt`\n\n8.  **Minimum Total Production Constraint (inspired by Problem B's minimum glass jars):**\n    To ensure sufficient supply, at least 200 units of Product B must be produced in total over the planning horizon.\n    *   `sum_{t=0 to 6} P_Bt >= 200`\n\nThis new problem is an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, fitting the type of Problem B, while leveraging the multi-period production and inventory context of Problem A."}
