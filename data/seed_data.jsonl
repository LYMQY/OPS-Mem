{"question": "A logistics company is managing the distribution of three types of goods: GoodsX, GoodsY, and GoodsZ. The company needs to decide how many trucks to allocate for each type of good to optimize delivery efficiency and minimize costs. Additionally, the company can invest in route optimization software to reduce travel time and fuel consumption, which affects the cost and efficiency of each delivery. The initial cost per truck for GoodsX is $1,000, but with optimization, the cost decreases by $10 for every $100 invested in optimization. The initial cost per truck for GoodsY is $1,200, and with optimization, the cost decreases by $12 for every $100 invested in optimization. The initial cost per truck for GoodsZ is $1,500, and with optimization, the cost decreases by $15 for every $100 invested in optimization. The company aims to minimize the total delivery cost for all goods. The company has a total of 50 trucks available for allocation. The budget for route optimization software is $10,000. Due to contractual obligations, the company must allocate at least 10 trucks for GoodsX and 15 trucks for GoodsY. The company wants to ensure that the total investment in optimization does not exceed the total cost savings from using the software. The reduction in delivery costs is linearly proportional to the amount of investment in route optimization software for each type of good.", "answer": 18000, "ori": "8_optibench", "index": 235}

{"question": "A manufacturing facility produces custom parts for seven jobs, labeled Job 0 through Job 6. Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in sequence, with the second operation starting only after the first is completed. Operations are assigned to specific machines, and some operations share the same machine, meaning they cannot be processed simultaneously. The goal is to schedule all operations to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan.\n\nEach operation has a processing time of 1 unit. For example, Operation 0 of Job 0 takes 1 unit of time, and Operation 1 of Job 0 also takes 1 unit of time. This applies to all operations across all jobs. Operations sharing the same machine must be scheduled such that one finishes before the other starts. Binary decision variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For instance, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 share a machine, a binary variable decides whether Operation 1 of Job 0 finishes before Operation 0 of Job 1 starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 finishes at time 2, the makespan must be at least 2. A large constant, 100,000, is used in the constraints to ensure that operations on the same machine do not overlap. The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring the facility operates as efficiently as possible while respecting all precedence and machine capacity constraints.", "answer": 3, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 81}

{"question": "Comp-Max Computers assembles computers and computer equipment. It is about to start production of three new types of computers, called model X, Y, and Z, respectively. Each type will require assembly time, inspection time, and storage space. The availability of each of these resources is limited. Specifically, available assembly time is 400 hours, available inspection time is 300 hours, and available storage space is 500 cubic feet (about 14.2 ms). The amount of each resource required for the different products is reported in the table below. For model X, assembly time is 1 hours, inspection time 2 hours, storage space 3 cubic feet. For model Y, assembly time is 2 hours, inspection time 3 hours, and storage space 4 cubic feet. For model Z, assembly time is 3 hours, inspection time 4 hours, and storage space 5 cubic feet. Model X earns a profit of $100 per unit, model Y earns a profit of $125 per unit, and model Z earns a profit of $200 per unit.
