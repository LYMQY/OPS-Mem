        "question": "You want to sell a kind of item in order to maximize your profit. Market research tells you that if you set the price at $1.50, you will be able to sell 5000 items, and for every 10 cents you lower the price below $1.50 you will be able to sell another 1000 items. You can only reduce the price by a multiple of 10 cents. Suppose that your fixed costs ( “start-up costs” ) total $2000, and the per item cost of production ( “marginal cost” ) is $0.50. Find the price to set per item and the number of items sold in order to maximize profit, and also determine the maximum profit you can get.",
