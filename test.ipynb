       "  'problem_description': '## New Optimization Problem: Strategic Nurse Staffing with Flexible Shifts and Workforce Constraints\\n\\nA leading healthcare provider, facing evolving operational demands and workforce management complexities, seeks to optimize its nurse staffing strategy. The hospital requires the following minimum number of nurses during different 4-hour time periods within a 24-hour day:\\n\\n*   **Period 1 (P1):** 2:00 - 6:00 - 10 nurses\\n*   **Period 2 (P2):** 6:00 - 10:00 - 15 nurses\\n*   **Period 3 (P3):** 10:00 - 14:00 - 25 nurses\\n*   **Period 4 (P4):** 14:00 - 18:00 - 20 nurses\\n*   **Period 5 (P5):** 18:00 - 22:00 - 18 nurses\\n*   **Period 6 (P6):** 22:00 - 2:00 - 12 nurses\\n\\nNurses can be hired from two categories: Regular Staff Nurses and Contract Nurses. To enhance flexibility and manage costs, the hospital now allows for two standard continuous shift durations, and introduces overtime options and new workforce constraints. All shifts must commence at the beginning of a 4-hour period (2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00).\\n\\n**Nurse Categories and Costs:**\\n\\n1.  **Regular Staff Nurses:**\\n    *   **Standard Shift:** Can work either a 4-hour shift or an 8-hour shift at a base salary of **$10/hour**.\\n    *   **Overtime Option:** Regular staff nurses assigned to an 8-hour shift can optionally extend their shift by an additional 4 hours (for a total of 12 continuous hours). The additional 4 hours are compensated at an overtime rate of **$15/hour**. Each regular nurse can be assigned to only one primary shift (4-hour or 8-hour) per day, and if an 8-hour shift, can opt for the single 4-hour extension.\\n2.  **Contract Nurses:**\\n    *   **Standard Shift:** Can work either a 4-hour shift or an 8-hour shift at a fixed rate of **$15/hour**. Contract nurses do not have an overtime option.\\n\\n**New Constraints and Strategic Objectives:**\\n\\nTo optimize staffing while meeting strategic organizational goals, the hospital must adhere to the following constraints:\\n\\n1.  **Workforce Cap for Regular Staff:** The total number of *individual* Regular Staff Nurses employed (across all 4-hour and 8-hour shifts) cannot exceed **40 nurses** in any 24-hour period.\\n2.  **Overtime Utilization Limit:** A maximum of **10 individual Regular Staff Nurses** can utilize the 4-hour overtime extension option across the entire 24-hour period.\\n3.  **Minimum Contract Nurse Presence:** To maintain a flexible pool and strong agency relationships, there must be at least **2 contract nurses** (from either 4-hour or 8-hour shifts) on duty during *each* of the six 4-hour time periods.\\n4.  **Minimum Regular Staff Coverage:** For continuity of care and institutional knowledge, at least **60% of the total nurse hours required** in any given 4-hour period must be covered by Regular Staff Nurses (including their overtime hours).\\n5.  **Shift Coverage:** The total number of nurses on duty during any 4-hour period must meet or exceed the specified demand for that period.\\n\\n**The Optimization Problem:**\\n\\nFormulate a mathematical optimization model to determine the optimal number of each type of nurse (Regular 4-hour, Regular 8-hour, Regular 8-hour with Overtime, Contract 4-hour, Contract 8-hour) to schedule for each batch starting time (2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00), such that the **total daily cost of nurse staffing is minimized** while satisfying all demand requirements and the new workforce constraints.',\n",
